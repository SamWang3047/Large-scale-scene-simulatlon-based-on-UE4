# MyProject
This project is my Graduation Project based on UE5 and C++. Here is the abstract:
 ## Abstract
Scene design refers to the modeling design of all objects that change with time, except for character modeling. It is an important part of the Game, as well as the Film and Television industries. Scenario simulation refers to simulating the real area for scenario design. In the natural geographical environment, vegetation forms several natural zones according to latitude and terrain height and forms vertical and horizontal distributions according to heat and moisture. This study proposes a method to efficiently produce the natural environment of the big world in the Unreal Engine. The research target selects the cold temperate zone in northern China and uses procedural content generation (PCG) technology to reconstruct the vegetation types and distribution patterns in this area to build a realistic 3D cold temperate game scene. Finally, the system can automatically cover materials, generate corresponding plant assets according to the real terrain, and has a weather system. This study digitizes the distribution law and seasonal performance of landforms and vegetation, and the generated scenes have important research significance for computational geography, digital content production, and game production.
